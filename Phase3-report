### 🧑‍💼 **Reserver**

**✅ Can do**

## Main page
Display same interface as **Guest**. List reservations with ressource names, starting and ending time, and the reserver.

## Add a new ressource
User can acces the `/ressource` using the **Add a new ressource** on the main page. It opens a form that request a title and a description.
Submitting form sends us back to the main page.
`/api/ressources` print a dark page with `{"error":"Not Found"}`.
❌ This behavior is not specified in specs description, and so is not supposed to be possible.

## Add a new reservation
User can acces the `/reservation` using the **Add a new reservation** on the main page. It opens a form that request username, the ressource, hours and minutes.
Submitting form sends us back to the main page. And now display the reserved ressource in the list.
There is no error detected by doing an overlap.
✅ Reservation is possible, as intended.
❌ Overlap is not detected and multiple reservation at the same time are possible
❌ It is possible to specify minutes on reservation, but "7. Resources can be booked on an hourly basis.", and so not on minutes should be possible.

## Log out
Clocking `Log Out` button leads us to the main page without account. Clicking button, changing from pages does not log us again in previous account.

## Invalid URL
Accessing unknow pages like `/asdaf` return error page. Notice that the error page name is "Staus", probably a mispell of "Status".
✅ Correct common behavior to avoir users to find unauthorized pages.

## Unauthorized page
Accessing unauthorized pages `/admin/users` return the error page.
However the `/admin/users:id` return a dark page with `{"error":"Not Found"}`.
✅ Correct common behavior to avoir users to find unauthorized pages.
❌ Do not work for specific pages.

### 🧑‍💼🛡️ **Administrator**

## Main page
Display same interface as **Guest**. List reservations with ressource names, starting and ending time, and the reserver.

**✅ Can do**

List actions an *Administrator* can perform.

* “Can add a resource — `/admin/resources/new`”
* “Can delete a reserver — `/admin/users/delete/:id`”
* “Can manage all reservations — `/admin/reservations`”
* “Can view all users (spec 4)”

---

**❌ Cannot do**

List prohibited behaviors, if any, or incorrect implementation issues.

Example format:

* “Cannot perform an action because the UI has no link (but API allows?) — flag as ⚠️”
